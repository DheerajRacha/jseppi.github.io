<h1>Hi There</h1>
<p>This is a relatively informal place for me to keep development notes and guides, mainly so I don't forget how I did something.  However, since I've benefitted from reading such blogs of others, I figured I should give back with my own ramblings.</p>

<h2>Recent Posts</h2>
{% for item in site.categories.articles limit:40 offset:0 %}  
    <p>{{ item.date | date: "%B %d, %Y" }} | <a href="{{item.url}}" title="{{item.title}}">{{item.title}}</a></p>
{% endfor %}

<p>If you see something wrong, or that could be done better, or that just rubs you the wrong way, please let me know!</p>
