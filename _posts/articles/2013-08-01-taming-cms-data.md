Earlier this year, the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)](www.cms.gov) released a great dataset - [Medicare Provider Charge Data](http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/index.html) for the top 100 most common inpatient services and the top 30 outpatient services. These data are quite interesting, as they show how in most cases, health service providers (ie hospitals), charge seemingly random costs to Medicare, but are reimbursed only a fraction of those charges. The reasoning behind hospital charges is a dark and mysterious art, and way out of my expertise, so I won't go any further into saying whether or not those charges are reasonable.

The CMS charge data are release as Excel and CSV files, which for a dataset containing data for all Medicare-accepting hospitals/providers in the country, are pretty difficult formats to work with.
